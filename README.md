# Kafka-wikipedia-event-streaming

A project, where I built a system that is Kafka-streams based, in order to produce statistics from the updates on different wikipedia pages.

we built the kafka-streams using java maven, running it simply by adding a proper maven configuration after running the producer code written in python.

I built a kafka cluster by creating a broker contains multiple topics in a bootstrap server and then we can consume the messages-event by connecting to localhost:9092
